DIGITAL VLSI SOC DESIGN AND PLANNING 




Task-1: SoC Design Flow Summary
The video explained the SoC design workflow, moving from specification to silicon.
🔹 Workflow Steps
    1. Chip Modelling (O1)
        ◦ Specifications are written in C model.
        ◦ Testbenches are developed in C for functional validation.
    2. RTL Architecture (O2)
        ◦ Hardware is described in RTL (Verilog).
        ◦ Components include the Processor and Peripherals/IPs.
    3. Synthesis & Netlist Generation
        ◦ RTL is converted into Gate-Level Netlist.
        ◦ Integration of Macros (synthesized RTL) and Analog IPs (functional RTL).
    4. SoC Integration (O3)
        ◦ All blocks are combined (Processor, IPs, Macros, Analog IPs).
        ◦ Integration also involves GPIOs and interconnects.
    5. Physical Design (RTL2GDS)
        ◦ Steps: Floorplanning → Placement → CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis) → Routing.
        ◦ Output: GDSII file.
    6. Final Verification & Fabrication
        ◦ DRC/LVS checks ensure design correctness.
        ◦ GDSII is sent for fabrication to produce the final chip.
🔹 Key Notes
    • Macros and Analog IPs can be hard macros (HM).
    • Processors are usually soft logic, but sometimes delivered as HM.
